# AI-enhanced-lyric-generator

### Project Description:
This project aims to develop a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model, specifically an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) or vanilla RNN, to analyze and generate song lyrics. Leveraging a large dataset of song lyrics, the project will involve application of natural language processing (NLP) techniques to clean, tokenize, and structure the text data for training a neural network. The ultimate goal is to create a model that not only understands the patterns and context within lyrics but can also generate coherent, contextually relevant text.

### Objectives:
1. **Data Collection and Preprocessing:** Start by loading a comprehensive dataset of song lyrics across multiple genres. The data preprocessing stage will clean the text by removing punctuation and special characters and then tokenize the lyrics into words, assigning each a unique numerical index.
  
2. **Vocabulary Building:** Develop a vocabulary list containing all unique words in the dataset. This vocabulary will serve as a foundation for converting lyrics to a format suitable for input into the model.

3. **Data Splitting:** Divide the dataset into training and testing sets, ensuring the training set contains sufficient data for model training and the testing set enables an unbiased evaluation of model performance.

4. **Model Training:** Train an RNN or LSTM model on the prepared training data. This will involve using the processed lyric data to teach the model sequential patterns and context within lyrics.

5. **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate the trained model on the testing set, using metrics such as accuracy and perplexity to assess performance. These metrics will indicate how well the model can predict the next word in a sequence or generate text with a coherent structure.

6. **Performance Tuning:** If the model does not meet performance expectations, retrain it with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, and number of layers) or apply alternative data preprocessing techniques to enhance performance.

7. **Model Saving:** Once the model achieves satisfactory results, save the trained model to allow for future use or deployment.

### Expected Outcomes:
- A trained RNN or LSTM model capable of generating contextually relevant lyrics based on learned patterns.
- Insight into the relationships and patterns found within lyrics, potentially leading to further applications in NLP-based text generation and analysis.

This project highlights the intersection of natural language processing and deep learning, creating a foundation for more advanced lyric generation, text analysis, or creative applications in the music industry.
